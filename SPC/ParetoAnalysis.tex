Pareto analysis is a statistical technique in decision making that is used for selection of a limited number of tasks that
produce significant overall effect. It uses the Pareto principle â€“ the idea that by doing 20\% of work, 80\% of the advantage
of doing the entire job can be generated.  Or in terms of quality improvement, a large majority of problems (80\%) are produced by a few key causes (20\%).
 
%============================================================================================================ %
Pareto analysis is a formal technique useful where many possible courses of action are competing for attention.
In essence, the problem-solver estimates the benefit delivered by each action, then selects a number of the most
effective actions that deliver a total benefit reasonably close to the maximal possible one.
