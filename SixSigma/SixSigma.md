### DMAIC
- Define : State problem, objectives, prioritize, and launch project
- Measure: Understand the Process, validate data accuracy, determine process capability
- Analyze : Determine the relationship between the Y's and the X's and look for causes.
- Improve: Determine solutions to achieve the objective, and implement.
- Control: Process control, monitoring and auto-controlling methods

### R package
- qcc 2.01 (*Scrucca [2004]*) Shewhart quality control charts for continuous, attribute and count data 
- IQCC 0.5 (*Recchia et al. [2010]*) Builds statistical control charts with exact limits for univariate and multivariate cases.
- qualityTools 1.47 (*Roth [2011]*) This is a package for teaching statistical methods in the field of Quality Science. The focus is on teaching

### qualityTools
The qualityTools package contains methods associated with the Define Measure Analyze Improve and Control (i.e. DMAIC) problem solving cycle of the Six Sigma Quality Management methodology. Usage of these methods is illustrated with the help of artificially created datasets.

- Define: Pareto Chart
- Measure: Probability and Quantile-Quantile Plots, Process Capability Ratios for various distributions and Gage R&R
- Analyze: Pareto Chart, Multi-Vari Chart, Dot Plot
- Improve: Full and fractional factorial, response surface, mixture and taguchi designs as well as the desirability approach for simultaneous optimization of more than one response variable. Normal, Pareto and Lenth Plot of effects as well as Interaction Plots
