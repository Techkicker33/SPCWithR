np-chart
%=============================================%
In statistical quality control, the np-chart is a type of control chart used to monitor the number of nonconforming units in a sample. An NP chart is a data analysis technique for determining if a measurement process has gone out of statistical control. It is sensitive to changes in the number of defective items in the measurement process. The “NP” in NP charts stands for the np (the mean number of successes) of a binomial distribution

In statistical quality control, the np-chart is a type of control chart used to monitor the number of nonconforming units in a sample. It is an adaptation of the p-chart and used in situations where personnel find it easier to interpret process performance in terms of concrete numbers of units rather than the somewhat more abstract proportion.[1]

The np-chart differs from the p-chart in only the three following aspects:

The control limits are {\displaystyle n{\bar {p}}\pm 3{\sqrt {n{\bar {p}}(1-{\bar {p}})}}} {\displaystyle n{\bar {p}}\pm 3{\sqrt {n{\bar {p}}(1-{\bar {p}})}}}, where n is the sample size and {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}} \bar p is the estimate of the long-term process mean established during control-chart setup.
The number nonconforming (np), rather than the fraction nonconforming (p), is plotted against the control limits.
The sample size, {\displaystyle n} n, is constant.
